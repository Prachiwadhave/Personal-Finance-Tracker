# Personal-Finance-Tracker
This Personal Finance Tracker is a Python-based web app to manage and track finances. Users can add transactions with details like category, amount, description, and payment method (e.g., UPI, card, cash). Data is stored in a CSV file, enabling users to view, analyze, and visualize spending patterns to better understand and manage their money.

This Personal Finance Tracker is built using Python and various libraries to develop a web application that helps users manage and track their finances effectively. The application allows users to add financial information, such as income and expenses, and stores the data in a CSV file.

Key features include:

Adding Financial Records: Users can record details about their transactions, including categories, amounts, descriptions, and payment methods (e.g., UPI, card, cash, or check).
Viewing Records: Users can view an overview of their financial data, including total amounts spent, credited, and a breakdown by categories.
Live CSV Integration: All financial data is stored in a live CSV file, making it easy to access and analyze at any time.
Data Visualization: The stored CSV data can be used to create visualizations and graphs, allowing users to track their spending habits and observe patterns over time.
This project serves as a simple yet powerful tool for managing personal finances while providing the flexibility to expand and integrate additional features, such as charts and analytics, in the future.
